                    </h4>
                    Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                    breathing
                    difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
                    syndrome,
                    kidney failure and even death.

                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth
                        and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with
                        anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                                                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives

                                                living
                                                in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are
                                                worried about the
                                                disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                                                towards Chinese or
                                                other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                                Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19
                                                spreads, a need to
                                                blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                                                rumors and
                                                myths.

                                                COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more
                                                during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to
                                                become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is
                                                not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather
                                                becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                                through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                                transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                                                eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and
                                                water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                                                your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                                                the bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface
                                                or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth,
                                                nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                                                the virus spreads.

                                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                                surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or
                                                packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                                                refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                                should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space
                                                between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from
                                                others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and
                                                avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an
                                                outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for
                                                symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your
                                                doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick,

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                                through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                                transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                                                eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and
                                                water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                                                your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                                                the bathroom.

                                            <p>
                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface
                                                or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth,
                                                nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                                                the virus spreads.

                                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                                surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or
                                                packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,

                                                cleaning
                                                your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your
                                                hands and avoid
                                                infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
